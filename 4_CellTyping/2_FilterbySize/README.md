# Cell Typing: Remove small objects

This directory contains the jupyter notebook "Filterby_RBCandSize.ipynb", used to identify objects that were identified during segmentation but are too small to be real cells. These, as well as previously identified RBCs, were removed before further analysis. 

"NS_vs_Custom_Seg.ipynb" was used to compare our final segmentation result to the default CosMx segmentation output provided for our dataset .
