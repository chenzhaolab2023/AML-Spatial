# Spatial Analysis

This directory contains jupyter notebooks and scripts used to analyze spatial relationships between cells in the following pahses: (1) Find the centroid of each cell, (2) Measure the edge-to-edge distance between all cells in each FOV (to be used for downstream analysis), (3) Use a linear mixed model to analyze the differences in cell types' density around leukemia cells across treament groups and timepoints, and (4) Look for cell types pairs engaged in receptor-ligand interactions.
