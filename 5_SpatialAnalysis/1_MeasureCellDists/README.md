# Spatial Analysis: Measure cell-cell edge-to-edge distances

This directory contains jupyter notebooks and scripts used measure the edge-to-edge distances between cells in each FOV. "snakefile_find_neighbors" executes a script that performs this process in all FOVs in parallel. We then used the notebook "Visualize_contacting_cells.ipynb" to visualize the number of directly touching neighbors each cell has.
